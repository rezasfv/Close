\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{Collections}
We developed our model using a collection of 1,593,376 documents and 882 queries provided by \textit{Qwant} search engine, available at \url{https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-5010}.
\newline
The collection contains information about user web searches and actual web pages corpora. The data was originally all in French but, for both queries and documents, an English translation is provided.


\subsection{Evaluation Measures}
To measure the effectiveness of our \ac{IR} system we used the \textit{trec\_eval} executable by testing it with the resulting runs produced by the model and its different configurations.
\newline
We tracked improvements of the following evaluation measures generated by \textit{trec\_eval}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{num\textunderscore ret}: number of documents retrieved for a given query.
	\item \textbf{num\textunderscore rel}: number of relevant documents for a given query.
	\item \textbf{num \textunderscore rel\textunderscore ret}: number of relevant documents retrieved for a given query.
    \item \textbf{map}: Mean Average Precision, a measure of the average relevance of retrieved documents across all queries. 
    \item \textbf{rprec}: R-Precision is the precision score computed at the rank corresponding to the number of relevant documents for a given query.
    \item \textbf{p@5} and \textbf{p@10}: Precision at 5 and at 10 is the precision computed at the top 5 and 10 retrieved documents for a given query.
    \item \textbf{nDCG}: it is a metric used to evaluate ranked lists. It measures the effectiveness of a ranking algorithm by considering item relevance.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Git Repository}
More detailed information about our information retrieval system, including source code, runs, results, homework reports, and presentation slides, can be found in our Git repository at \url{https://bitbucket.org/upd-dei-stud-prj/seupd2223-close/src/master/%7D}. 
The code is available for reproducibility.
